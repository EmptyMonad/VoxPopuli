Map Painter for Continental Representatives



#What is Vox Populi?
The goal of Vox Populi is to serve as a visual representation of how popular the congressional representatives of Texas are, 
based strictly on what they have voted on recent bills, rather than biased news articles or party lines. Users are able to view 
recent bills voted on each representative, decide whether they approve or disapprove of the representative’s vote, and vote accordingly. 
These votes are then factored into an overall score for each representative, and their respective district is painted accordingly based on 
the overall score. Right now, our scale is earth-toned with lighter shades of green for increasing popularity, and darker shades of brown 
for decreasing popularity. This is version 1.0 of Vox Populi, so expect many improvements and new features in the near future.


#How Do I Use Vox Populi?
1.	On the homepage, you will see 4 icons on the top left of the website located on the sidebar. The icon that is second from the 
top is used for logins, and the icon third from the top is used for new user registrations. Select the register button if you are a new user 
and register an account. Otherwise, login to your account to be able to vote on representative actions.


2.	Click on the person icon in the top right of the sidebar. This will pull out the representative information tab. Then, hover 
over the Texas districts. This will give you some quick information on the representative and the district number. Or you can simply 
zoom in on the map to find out which district specific cities or locations are in.


3.	When a district is clicked, the user is redirected to the that representatives web page. There you will see 20 recent bills and 
what that representative voted on each bill. Obviously, you are unlikely to know if you support a bill without reading it. Click on the bill 
icon for each respective bill, and you will be redirected to the congress.gov webpage for the bill, and you can read a plethora of information 
on the legislation, including the raw text of the bill.

4.	Navigate back to the representative webpage. Rather than voting on the bill itself, it is important to keep in mind you are voting 
for the REPRESENTATIVE’S vote on the bill. For instance, if you decide you support this bill, but the representative voted NO, you will 
hit the downvote button. However, if you support a bill and they voted YES on that bill, you will hit the upvote button.
